Hi Vince,
?
Hope you are fine. I hope that Grant's  leaving?hasn't affected your group 
too much?
?
EPRM's Paul Bristow has been in touch about a VaR  training course involving 
Les, yourself and I. Are you interested? We would  be?extremely happy to work 
with you. He was talking about London and  Houston which I don't know if it 
fits with your travel schedule. Maybe we can  sort something out.
?
I hope to have the next article with you by early  next week.
?
Best regards as always, and many thanks for your  book promotional efforts!
?
Chris.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to receiving a
copy of your article.

I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether Enron provides
research grants to individuals who are working in the area of Energy Risk
Management.  Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to estimate
electricity spot price.

In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down the
line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because Enron is my
dream job.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Good Morning, Vince!

After going over our department list, I believe that, with the exception of a 
part-timer or two, we have covered everybody in the newsletter.  If we have 
recently hired someone who might not be on the list, would you please let me 
know?  Also, if you have a good article from someone that we can use for a 
Technical Corner, we will need that, too.  I'm going to put out a general 
call for TC material today.  Hopefully, we will get several things we can use 
for the coming weeks.

Dear Professor Duffie,


I enclosed with this e-mail Enron Storage Analysis  Model (SAM) for your 
review.  The attached files include: 
 1) a brief documentation of the model (SAM.doc), 2) c-code of the main 
routines, 3) Excel spreadsheet interface, 
4) SAM_audit.dll .

Dr. Vince Kaminski, Dr. Stinson Gibner and myself have spent about one year 
in developing this model.  
With traders, feedback incorporated, the model results are close to reality.  
Although there are features to be included, 
we believe the model is ready for your review.  We look forward to your 
comments and suggestions. 


Please feel free to contact me should you need additional detail.  


Sincerely,

"Norma,

It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and
merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the 
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.

As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity 
raises.
The column totals are misleading.

I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).

Vince --

Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San 
Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market 
discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows 
the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.

Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their 
B-school in the evenings.

Thanks.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor
Dept. of Industrial Engineering
and Operations Research
4117 Etcheverry Hall
University of California
Berkeley, CA 94720-1777

"Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC

with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same

No changes in the schedule. The meeting will take place, as scheduled,
on the 6th of December at 9:00 a.m. We may have to cancel lunch with the 
professors as they have other commitments. The meeting will last
about 2 hours.

Vince "
"Chris,

I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.

1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation 
equation and
the way it's typically discretized.

2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain 
what CT is (perhaps a footnote).


I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.

******************************************************************************
***************
 1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
Houston):

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the best
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth 
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be 
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in 
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron 
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference 
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
expectations.

Thanks,

Enron Team 3 (Retail)

Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's ""new economy"" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Dan sent this information as a follow up to our meeting this week.  If there 
is any additional information you would like to see, please let me know.

In the absense of any objections, I would like to begin having our analysts 
use the Financial Stress score to underwrite small exposures where financial 
statements are not received.  In addtion to saving some expense, this will 
allow greater consistentency.  And moving forward, I believe we can map 
expected defaults from FStress score ranges to those implied in credit 
spreads, and in doing so map to E-ratings for use in credit reserve 
analytics.  I've had prelimiary discussions with Rabi and Amititava regarding 
this.

Any additional insights would be helpful, and thanks for your help.

Mark,

Attached are a presentation on the Financial Stress Score and the countries
that have risk scores available today. Please let me know if you have any
questions.

In response Vince's question regarding false positives from the model, that
is a little difficult to answer.  The model is predicting the likelihood of
a company experiencing financial distress.  We are not saying that all
companies with a high risk score will experience financial distress.  In
other words, it is not really a yes or no proposition.  It' not like a drug
test where the test either comes back positive or negative and ocassionally,
you get a false positive test result.  We are identifying companies that are
at high risk for failure.  Some of those high risk companies will fail and
some will not fail.  How many in each classification that will ultimately
fail is addressed in the performance charts attached below.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or need any additional
information.

Subject: Demonstration Proposal Status/Meeting


Vince:

I have come up for air since the holiday and all the machinations that have
befallen the California power markets.  Great for consultants and
independent generators and inbound FT owners but not perhaps so great for
others.  Lots of entropy in the system indeed!

I plan to be in Houston next week from Tuesday through Friday and would like
very much to get 1/2 hour of your time to kick off the demonstration project
I proposed just before Christmas if you are ready.  We are ready to provide
the top quality service that will be needed to give you and your gas guys
the concerted demonstration project you wanted.  I would prefer any time
Friday 1/26 or Wednesday 1/24 first thing in the morning if you have
flexibility.

We were able over the holiday to really make a lot of progress on finalizing
all of our fundamental modeling technologies--short and long run gas and
short and long run electricity.  I am really jacked up how our long run
models are predicting the amount of capacity that can profitably be absorbed
in ERCOT and where, the amount of capacity that can profitably be absosrbed
in California and the WSCC and where, and where gas price basis is likely to
go.  As you saw, our long run capacity addition technique is quite unique,
and I have not yet introduced the long run electric and gas models broadly
in the industry.  It is possible and realistic for Enron to get first mover
advantage (or perhaps more) based on the results of the demonstration
project we discussed.  Let's talk about that next week when we meet.

If you could confirm one of the two suggested times via email or phone at
650.218.3069 in the next day or two, that would be terrific.  I look forward
to seeing you again and to working together.

Also, I would like to get your advice regarding prospective investors in
MarketPoint.  I am starting to get serious inquiries from large companies
you know well who want to invest in MarketPoint as an equity paly, but I am
very reluctant to consider such investments by organizations other than
absolute, unequivocal industry leaders such as Enron.  I remember discussing
this briefly with you, but I would like to get your input with the benefit
of six more months thought if you would be willing when we meet.

Thanks, and all the best.

Subject: Re: GARP 2001 Convention


Dear Vince

Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
two-day GARP Convention. Unfortunately, it is not GARP's policy to allow
this for a number of reasons: GARP is a not-for-profit organisation, will
much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other
conference organizers. GARP's mission is to allow an educational forum for
furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However,
in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a
50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in Enron. This
will be for the two-day Convention and will include the Gala Awards Evening
on 13th February, which had over three financial and risk professionals at
GARP 2000.

I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of
this, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering
note referring to this e-mail, and I will ensure that our administration
depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to your response and to meeting you in New York in February
(and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).

Kind regards

Andreas

Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Subject:  GARP 2001 Convention



Dear GARP 2001 Speaker

This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th
February, 2001.

Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP
2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention.
Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a
result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management
Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I
will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
the  event.

Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:

1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and
New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure
you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to
be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required
as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you
bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy
disc or a laptop.

2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what
audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection -
notably PowerPoint).

3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact
me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.

I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.

Kind regards

Andreas

Hi Shirley,

Thanks for your message.  It's not surprising that someone who is as busy
as Dr. Kaminski is running a bit behind.  I've organized a number of
conferences, and it always turns out that the best speaker is the last one
to get his presentation ready.  We are very lucky to have him speak at our
conference, and I am happy to help.

There will be an SVGA data projector with an LCD colour data projector and
screen available.

If he would like the conference participants to have copies of his material
during his presentation, perhaps he could take it to the hotel's 24-hour
business services area when he arrives (or when it's ready) and I will pick
up the copies before registration begins at 8:00.  If he doesn't mind me
waiting to distribute the copies on the first break, I can take care of the
copying once everyone is seated and his talk begins.

If he chooses to have the copies ready first thing in the morning, please
have him request 55 (three-hole punched) copies to be charged to the
University of Waterloo's function.  If it's all right to hand them out
later, he can bring me the diskette when he comes down to the Stuart
meeting room on the third floor.  I will be there for registration and
continental breakfast beginning at 8:00.

Please let me know which he prefers.

Thanks!

Amy

I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the 
summer).
I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons. I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader
in not too distant future. He needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research. I think it will be in the best interest of 
the company
to devote some resources to foster his development.

Subject: Economic Espionage Act Presentation - August 15th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  ""Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)"".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
""hypothetical"" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence.  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.  Hope to 
see you there.


 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the ""Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA),"" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Vince,

Good morning.

Further to your forthcoming visit this Wed., I write to clarify last-minute
details:

1.  Your ETA/ETD.  Will you be available to join us for lunch and/or dinner?

2.  Your AV requirements, if any.  Should you need either, we have an
overhead projector as well as laptop capability (either YOUR laptop, or we
can with advance notice reserve a laptop if you bring floppies).

BTW, any developments re Jeff Skilling's 2/22 conference keynote?

Best,

"John,

Sorry for the confusion.
This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute.

been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

Vince

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's ""new economy"" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance

Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your

as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and
graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have
in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring
to my LSU classes.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to
seeing you once again.

Subject: El Paso / ENA Deal Completely Terminated Now

El Paso, Enron Terminate $38 Million Mega-Deal

     In a stunning announcement late yesterday, El Paso Natural Gas said it 
had reached a
     ""mutual agreement"" with Enron North America Corp. to terminate the $38 
million
     negotiated mega-deal for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity that the marketer had 
entered into in
     December. The negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity 
agreements. 

     The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was 
somewhat
     puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one 
contract - the
     famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that 
FERC had
     placed on the delivery rights of the capacity. In a Jan. 27 letter, 
Enron notified El Paso
     of its intent to exit the Block II contract, but the letter didn't 
indicate that it wanted to
     terminate the Blocks I and III contracts. See Daily GPI, Feb. 3) 

     ""They asked for it [to be released] and we agreed to it. It was a mutual 
agreement,""
     said El Paso spokesman Mel Scott. The capacity agreements will be 
terminated on Jan.
     31. Afterward, El Paso said it will hold open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 
14 for the
     capacity. 

     ""It is unfortunate that the recent FERC order modified the capacity 
rights in a way that
     will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that Enron North 
America originally
     intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions. In the interest 
of fairness and
     good customer relations, we have agreed to release them from the 
contracts,"" said John
     W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group. 

     El Paso Natural Gas has asked FERC to reconsider the mid-January order 
that
     essentially has reduced the commercial value of the Block II firm 
transportation
     capacity that Enron had agreed to acquire. With the collapse of its 
contract deal with
     Enron, it couldn't be immediately determined whether El Paso will 
continue to pursue
     rehearing. 

     El Paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by FERC in its request 
to stay the
     provision in the order restricting delivery rights of Block II capacity. 

     The pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which FERC said El 
Paso's 1996
     turned-back capacity settlement bars El Paso from marketing Block II 
capacity on a
     primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at Pacific Gas &
     Electric-Topock, AZ. That ruling stripped the Block II capacity of 
primary delivery
     access to the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point, which is 
the most
     sought-after by shippers of San Juan Basin gas. 

     It was a major blow to El Paso and Enron, which had contracted for the 
Block II
     capacity in December on the condition that it would have primary 
delivery access to the
     Southern California market.. 

     Without a favorable decision on rehearing, ""the result may well be a 
diminution of the
     value of Block II capacity,"" El Paso told FERC. ""Without question, 
Enron, as a new
     shipper on the capacity"" and future holders of that capacity ""will 
suffer a disadvantage in
     the market...."" 

     El Paso contends the Commission's ruling, if unchanged, would thwart the 
intent of the
     1996 settlement, which called for the pipeline and its customers to 
share the risks of
     unsubscribed capacity on El Paso's system, and for El Paso to share a 
portion of the
     revenues it received from re-marketing the capacity. 

     ""An essential element in El Paso's ability to maximize the revenues it 
agreed to share
     with its firm customers was the ability to market the 614 MMcf/d of 
Block II capacity
     on a primary basis to delivery points other than PG&E-Topock,"" the 
pipeline noted.
     Stripping El Paso of delivery-point flexibility for Block II capacity 
""will have a serious
     adverse impact on [its] ability to generate the maximum possible 
revenues for its
     capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would 
otherwise have to
     absorb."" 

     El Paso further said the Commission's decision was at odds with a 1998 
order
     addressing whether the pipeline could re-market capacity turned back by 
PG&E to the
     SoCal-Topock delivery point on a primary basis. Since the 1996 
settlement was silent
     on whether El Paso could re-market the capacity to delivery points other 
than
     PG&E-Topock, the Commission reasoned the settlement didn't preclude El 
Paso from
     selling the capacity at SoCal-Topock. 

     ""That ruling established the proper interpretation of the 1996 
settlement. Now, the
     Commission has re-interpreted that same provision in a manner that is 
completely
     contrary to its previous ruling. The Commission provides no explanation 
as to how
     these two rulings can be reconciled or, alternatively, why it has 
changed its mind...."" 

     El Paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it ""cannot find any 
evidence"" in the
     mid-January order that the Commission ""even read, much less considered"" 
its response
     as to the ""proper interpretation"" of the1996 settlement.

I spoke to an analyst who is currently working for Koch in Wichita, and is 
about to be laid off.  He is going to stay until he gets his severance, and 
thinks that may be in about 4-6 weeks.  His current salary is $80k.  His last 
raise was 2 years ago, and at that time he was making $74k.  His last bonus 
was also two years ago, which was $30k.  He is considering Enron as one of 
his options.  If you are interested, feel free to give him a call at work.  

Thanks!

Hi Vince!

Maybe you remember me, my name is Andrew Miles and we worked together on a 
speech for Jeff Skilling this past July.  I am hoping that I can get on your 
calendar for 30 minutes next week.  I have been working with 3 other Enron 
employees for the past 6 months, developing a comprehensive innovation 
acceleration process for use by potentially all Enron employees - and we 
would really appreciate your input.  We have presented the idea to quite a 
few people in the company, and some outside of the company (Strategos 
Institute), all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input.  
Many people have suggested that we run the idea by you.

If you have some time next week, would you mind allowing me to explain our 
ideas to you?  I will follow up with a telephone call.

All the best,

Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your

national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate

a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to

"Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor 
or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal 
customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that 
Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but 
have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I 
hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I 
just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through 
Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your

 my thought is that you should attend the presentation, because it is our

to gauge how well the model backtests (is it just another academic model?), 
and what are the sources of data.  Do not elaborate on your model -- your

"Molly,

Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman,
Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.

I talked to him in New York and he is considering
other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think John will like him more than Punit.



Thanks

Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed 
distribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe 
contract.

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an 
economic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not 
exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

Korea:

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's 
currency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since 
January.

Brazil:

Argentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in 
January. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.




Thoughts and comments welcome.

After Six Years, Profit From Company's Power Operations Remains Years
Away
By Elizabeth Williamson

The Wall Street Journal Europe

  NOWA SARZYNA, Poland -- From a small power plant humming among the
birches near the Ukrainian border, Enron Corp. has staked its claim on
the Polish energy market.

   Yet after six years, the company is still seeking a mother lode.
   The Houston-based energy producer and trader entered Poland in 1994,
nabbed one of the first power-trading licenses to go to a foreign
company and began work on Elektrocieplownie Nowa Sarzyna, Poland's first
new, foreign-operated heat-and-power plant.

   Other companies followed, including Electricite de France, RWE AG of
Germany, Vattenfall AB of Sweden and Tractebel SA of Belgium.

   The prize could be a rich one. All of these companies hope to profit
as Poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining
the European Union.

   A wholesale power bourse is due to open in Warsaw in July. And the
country's transmission links to markets East and West could make Poland
the power-trading hub of Central Europe.

   But after six years in Poland, Enron has yet to earn a profit. Net
income from Nowa Sarzyna, which is to begin commercial production later
this month, is at least five years away. Power-trading operations might
generate profits next year, if the new bourse gets moving. But that is
""one big question mark,"" says Jarek Astramowicz, Enron Poland's
president.

   Indeed, despite its promise, Poland's energy sector remains a
sizzling tangle of aging plants, archaic market agreements and complex,
shifting regulations.

   Enron, with $40 billion (41.69 billion euros) in annual revenue, is
an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers. But in a power
market as negatively charged as Poland's, the company also is an example
of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors
offline.

   ""These are very large operations and to some extent they can bear
some risks,"" says Pawel Kaminski, energy-sector operations officer at
the World Bank in Warsaw. ""But eventually they have to generate some
return.""

   Enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the U.S. It
entered Europe in 1989, setting up in London as the U.K.'s energy sector
liberalized. It entered the Nordic market in 1996, and today is the Nord
Pool's largest-volume trader.

   Enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits
for a power plant, and a further 29 months for construction.

   Just four years after entering the U.K., Enron finished its
1,875-megawatt Teesside plant. Teesside's capacity and cost, at GBP 795
million (1.32 billion euros), are many times larger than Nowa Sarzyna's.
Yet Teesside was completed in only two-thirds the time. The company
declines to compare development times in various countries.

   ""I wouldn't necessarily put Poland into the same category as Russia,""
says Philip Davies, regulatory and government-affairs manager at Enron
Europe in London. ""But obviously, given Poland's (planned economy) past,
it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process
and get to the starting point.""

   At Nowa Sarzyna, it took Enron nearly twice the usual time to reach
the starting point, even though Mr. Astramowicz already knew the site,
and the Polish power industry's rules.

   The Nowa Sarzyna plant was Mr. Astramowicz's brainchild, and he
burned out the engine in his first BMW as he traveled between Warsaw and
the town to craft the deal. A freelance energy-sector entrepreneur
before joining Enron, Mr. Astramowicz sold his interest in Nowa Sarzyna
to Enron in 1998.

   Enron has spent $132 million to build Nowa Sarzyna, a 116-megawatt,
gas-fired combined heat-and-power plant. Quiet, clean and efficient, the
plant stands in stark contrast to most of Poland's belching, coal-fired
behemoths. When it starts up this month, it will sell its electricity to
the Polish Power Grid, the country's high-voltage network, under a
20-year power-purchase agreement, or PPA, that Enron won in 1997. Steam
output goes to Organika, the chemical company next door, and helps heat
the town of Nowa Sarzyna.

   The Nowa Sarzyna plant is more than 80% financed by commercial-bank
loans for which the only collateral is the plant's concluded contracts.

   ""They were betting on their good name,"" says Michael Davies, a
partner with Allen & Overy, the Warsaw law firm that advised Enron
Poland's lenders. ""They are pushing envelopes all the time.""

   That is especially true in a market with 30% overcapacity, where an
energy law didn't even exist until 1997.

   Says Peter Bisztyga, emerging Europe utilities analyst at Solomon
Smith Barney in London: ""Because Enron signed a PPA, they are OK . . .
(but) I'm really not sure building Nowa Sarzyna was such a good idea.""

   Mr. Bisztyga says Enron could have generated a faster return by
renovating an existing power plant. But, he acknowledges, Nowa Sarzyna
""allowed Enron to get into the Polish market early and stamp their name
on it.""

   In 1994, Polish power plants weren't for sale. Energy asset
privatization, discussed for years, began in earnest only this year. By
2002, the Polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of
power plants, 33 distribution companies and the Polish Power Grid, a
12,000-kilometer national transmission network of high-voltage lines.
The assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys (8.4 billion
euros), but murky regulations have driven prices down.

   ""The regulations don't promote competition and so you don't really
know the price of electricity,"" says Bengt Wegemo, president of
Vattenfall Poland. Earlier this year, Vattenfall paid $235 million for
55% in Warsaw-based Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie, promising $340
million in investment in the heat-and-power plant over the next 10
years.

   Investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing.
Ultimately, 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will
trade on the bourse, setting the wholesale price of electricity. The
Polish bourse will be modeled on its Nordic counterpart. Enron, the Nord
Pool's largest trader, hopes to post Polish trading profits by 2001.

   But first, say market experts, Poland's 1997 energy law must be
amended to ease functioning of the bourse, and free up access to
Poland's distribution network.

   Further, the government says it must solve the competition problem
posed by the Polish Power Grid's power-purchase agreements, which
account for 70% of energy sales in Poland. Some state-owned plants used
the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing. When
prices are freed, these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete
with plants that didn't spend money to modernize.

   The government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the
modernized plants for their extra costs. Though Nowa Sarzyna is a
private plant, the price Enron must charge for its power is about twice
what outmoded plants charge.

   ""We are hoping that continuous, efficient operation of the plant will
generate us a (bigger) profit,"" Mr. Astramowicz says.

   Another problem is cross-border power trading, where contradictory
legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the Polish Power Grid, also
known as PSE. Enron and others protest that PSE shouldn't compete with
electricity-market participants who contract with it for transmission
service.

   PSE intends to stay in the trading business, says Marek Zerka, PSE's
vice president. In late March, PSE and local company Kulczyk Holding
signed an agreement with PreussenElektra AG of Germany to export
electricity and coal to EU countries via Germany.

   ""This is great news,"" Mr. Astramowicz says. ""If this joint venture
gets access to PSE's cross-border transmission capacity . . . I would
expect PSE to confirm open access to all market participants.""

   Enron and others are pushing hard for that access. ""As soon as the
market becomes open, free and non-discriminatory, we will come out at a
decent profit,"" Mr. Astramowicz says.

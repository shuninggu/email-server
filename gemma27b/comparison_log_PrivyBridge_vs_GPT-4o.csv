3,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.
 As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.  The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  
 My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.","Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions. I agree that separating the business meetings from the trip could make both more enjoyable and productive. Holding the meetings in a round table discussion format sounds like a great way to encourage more interaction and honest feedback. 

As for the trip, Austin sounds like a fantastic option with plenty of activities to enjoy. I appreciate your input and will consider it as we plan. Let's also gather some opinions from the team to see if the trip is desired or necessary.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
 start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
 to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
 another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
 my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
 in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
 past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
 the enormous number of things she does everyday.  Fortunately, it looks as
 if she will be ok in the long run.

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 Phillip,
  Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
 requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
 trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
 the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
 on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
 consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
 consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
 inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
 consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
 arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
 happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
 consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
 building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
 future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
 requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
 plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
 The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
 themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
 project.
 I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
 good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
 we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
 positions, I think we still have the following issues:
 We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group. We've had 
 three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
 traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
 requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
 We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
 be outside the scope of position consolidation.
 Things left to do:
 I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
 make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
 project. It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
 Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
 project and which fall out of scope.
 For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
 work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
 Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
 drill downs.
 Use the above to formulate a project plan.
 Things requested thus far (no particular order):
 Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
 ticker.
 Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
 add up existing position manager rows/columns).
 New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
 transport, swaps, options, ...
 Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
 of all curves on which the desk has a position.
 Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
 shown directly above monthly positions. Each grouped column in the top grid 
 would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
 Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
 appropriate positions to show for each:
 Gas Daily for monthly index,
 Physical gas for Nymex,
 Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
 Physical gas for Mid market.
 Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
 using official valuations.
 Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
 Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
 Inclusion of spread options in our systems. Ability to handle volatility 
 skew and correlations.
 Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
 Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
 gamma grid.
 Valuation of Gas Daily options.
 A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta). TBD.
 Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
 Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
 manager.
 Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker. Show new deal terms, 
 prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
 Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
 Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
 individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
 Benchmark positions in TDS.
 Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
 and explicit position break out issues.
 -- Allan.
 PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
 transport. Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
 point.","Hi Richard,

 Westgate
 Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
 Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
 on San Marcos that you received earlier.
 If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
 Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?
 San Marcos
 The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
 sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for $2.50 per square
 foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
 San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.
 Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
 and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
 $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This
 property will have the best location for student housing of all new
 projects, just as the duplexes do now.
 If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
 is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
 yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. I will
 know more on this question later today.

Thank you for providing the demographics on the Westgate site and the information regarding the San Marcos property. I appreciate the detailed insights into the potential of these projects.

Regarding the Westgate project, I would like to review the demographics further and will get back to you with any questions or additional information requirements. As for my interest level, I am intrigued by the opportunity and would like to discuss it further once I have a clearer understanding of the equity requirements.

The San Marcos property also sounds promising, especially with the potential for higher rents and its prime location for student housing. I am interested in exploring this opportunity further and would appreciate any additional details you can provide, particularly regarding the equity requirement once it becomes available.

Thank you for keeping me informed, and I look forward to our continued discussion.

Best regards,

  From: Phillip K Allen  09/28/2000 10:56 AM
  
 Liane,
  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
 manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single 
 buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
 market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, 
 offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
 bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
 calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
 financial swaps for San Juan.
  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
 September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from 
 Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
 firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
 trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas 
 daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
 relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:
  1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
 than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 
  2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
 Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and 
  October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
 are dramatically different.
  I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the 
 trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
 determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
 outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
 establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
 $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
 calculation of index.
  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
 conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me 
 anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
 Sincerely,
 Phillip Allen","Hi Phillip Allen,

 Subject: Investment Structure
 STRUCTURE:
 Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
 general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
 liability of construction.
 LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
 The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
 any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
 the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
 all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
 loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
 that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
 is reduced.
 All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
 full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
 the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
 non-recourse.
 USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
 The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
 architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
 organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
 many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
 Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
 the estimated 6 month design and approval period.
 EARLY LAND COSTS
 The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
 represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
 extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
 probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
 price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
 monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
 approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.
 EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
 Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
 the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
 the ""fiscals"". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
 improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
 improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
 for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
 completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
 expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
 improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
 irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
 development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
 spent no interest is charged on these funds.
 The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
 finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
 high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
 $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
 obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
 provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
 improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.  Even if the maximum loan would
 cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
 spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
 preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
 tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
 significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.
 Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
 lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.  Of this, probably
 $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The
 improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
 costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
 landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for
 undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
 estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the
 loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give
 you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
 of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
 is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
 separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
 standpoint.
 CONSTRUCTION LOANS
 There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
 (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is
 a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
 builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
 loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
 start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
 in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any
 construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
 difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.
 Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
 pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
 be from 80% to 95% of value.
 DISBURSEMENTS
 Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
 near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
 payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
 will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
 fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
 These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
 calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
 expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
 to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
 cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
 function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
 from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
 Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
 used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
 any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
 to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.
 REPORTING
 We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
 What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
 reporting.
 BOOKKEEPING
 I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
 procedures to record actual expenses?"" Please expand.
 INVESTOR INPUT
 We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. As always
 the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
 experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
 Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
 effort to be accommodating.
 CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
 CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
 formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
 obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
 subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
 for vendors they are constantly shopped.
 PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
 Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
 provide these if you are interested.
 I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
 when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

 Just wanted to give you an update. I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings. At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing. Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid. Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

 Subject: closing
 Jeff, 
 ?
 Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isn't binding 
 as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesn't sound like 
 anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate 
 closing--but, of course, I could be wrong.? 
 ?
 If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is 
 no point in me following up on this?document's validity.? 
 ?
 I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what's there and 
 find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can.
 ?
 I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable 
 document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? 
 This isn't either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last 
 night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
 this is out of his area but doesn't sound binding to him.? 
 ?
 I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's transaction?and take a look at 
 that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even 
 needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
 need to contact me regarding the closing.
 ?
 I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself 
 and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn't 
 seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my 
 signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it 
 reviewed before I accept it.
 ?
 Brenda

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns regarding the closing documents. I understand your hesitation given the vagueness of the agreement. It's important to ensure everything is in order before proceeding.

I will review the documents on my end and consult with the necessary parties to clarify the situation. If your signature is indeed required, I will ensure you have ample time to have the document reviewed by a real estate attorney.

  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
 project:
  Ownership Structure
  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?
  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
 capacity(regarding ownership and 
  liabilities)?
  Who owns the land? improvements?
  Who holds the various loans?
  Is the land collateral?
  Investment
  
  What happens to initial investment?
  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
  
  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?
  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
 schedule?
  Investment Return
  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?
  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
 are distributed?
  Debt
  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
 is associated with each 
  loan?
  Improvement
  Construction
  Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement.
  Terms of each loan?
  Uses of Funds
  How will disbursements be made? By whom?
  What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
 for investors?
  Reports to track expenses vs plan?
  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?
  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get 
 paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
  general contractor and paid gain out of profits?
  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
 before the ultimate payout of profits?
  Design and Construction
  
  When will design be complete?
  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?
  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
 planning and permitting?
  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
 vendors, and other professionals? 
  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?
  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
 use? Names?
 These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
 in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as
 much as possible from the process.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
 start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
 to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
 another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
 my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
 in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
 past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize

  Here sales numbers from Reagan:
  
  
  As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 
 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
 units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
 under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
 competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
 actually done to date. 
  Let me know what you think. I will follow up with an email and phone call 
 about Cherry Creek. I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
 rejected on the De Ville property.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to

 Subject: Sagewood Town Homes
 I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
 duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's, He does have a much
 lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
 to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
 We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
 the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
 footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his
 sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
 for $203,108.
 What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
 rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
 evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
 were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
 units along with the 3-bedroom plan.

  Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
 opportunities.
  I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
 built by Reagan Lehmann. 22 Units were sold for 
  around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
 that he had more units under construction that would be 
  available in the 180's. Are the units he is selling significantly different 
 from yours? He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
  plan. My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  
  As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  
  Call or email with your thoughts.
 Phillip","Hi Phillip,

 Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth. I 
 have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
 The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
 distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
 power quality reasons.
 The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
 to server farms and technology companies. There is a 100 MW server farm 
 trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
 due to distribution infrastructure issues. Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
 Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
 awakening in the next 2-3 years.

 Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
  Local Utilities 
  ( September 05, 2000 ) 
  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
 Tukwila. 
  The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
 computer servers for the
  region's growing number of dot-coms. 
  Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
 construction
  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
 a mile from its
  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
 fiber optic backbones, the
  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
 eventually
  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
 Microsoft and Onvia.com. 
  Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
 centers near Seattle.
  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
 Globix and
  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
 the networking
  equipment of the Internet economy. 
  It is a big business that could have an effect on 
 everything from your
  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
 your favorite Web sites.
  Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
 server farms, are
  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
 Valley that some
  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
 Puget Sound
  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
 high-security
  facilities. 
  ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
 are requesting 445
  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
 said Karl
  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
 Energy. ""That is
  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 
  A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
 the rise of the Internet
  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
 heads. 
  Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
 Utilities and
  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
 data centers. The
  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
 residential and business
  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
 necessary to support
  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
 million each,
  Karzmar said. 
  Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
 bring up the data center
  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 
  For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
 businesses and schools in the
  region, this is a new and complex issue. 
  On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
 appetite for power --
  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
 facilities run 24 hours a
  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
 constant revenue
  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
 they could
  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
 expenditures. 
  Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
 mean for power rates
  in the area is still open to debate. 
  ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
 loads,"" said Bob Royer,
  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
 City Light. 
  ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
 lights at the football
  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
 We have data
  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
 and 50 megawatts."" 
  With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
 complex in Tukwila is
  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
 the 1.35 million
  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
 Boeing Space &
  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
 92 percent of the
  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
 companies. 
  ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
 country,"" boasts Laurent
  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
 Communications,
  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
 Networks all
  lease space in the office park. 
  After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
 Sabey has become an
  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
 management or
  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
 claims his firm is
  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
 the country. 
  As more people access the Internet and conduct 
 bandwidth-heavy tasks
  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
 co-location space in
  Seattle continues to escalate. 
  But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
 space is growing at a
  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
 causing similar
  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
 California. 
  Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
 space, plans to nearly
  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
 While companies
  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
 high-tech companies
  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
 as Exodus that
  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
 management. 
  ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
 construction and we plan to
  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
 demand right now
  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
 executive at Exodus in
  Seattle. 
  The booming market for co-location space has left some 
 in the local utility
  industry perplexed. 
  ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
 to serve the growth,""
  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
 almost stunned by this, in
  a way.""","Hi Jeff,

Thanks for forwarding this along. It's fascinating to see the impact the Internet economy is having on power demand and infrastructure. The growth in server farms and data centers is certainly something to keep an eye on, especially with the challenges it presents to utility companies. Let's discuss how we might need to adjust our strategies in light of these developments.

Best regards,

Phillip","Hi Jeff,

Thanks for forwarding this insightful email. The impact of the Internet economy on load growth is indeed significant and it’s crucial to stay ahead of these changes.

 Hi Phillip. We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team

 Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
 we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the
 database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the
 ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
 require additional information.
 We need each person's email address. Without the email address, we cannot
 email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
 we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have
 each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.
 So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
 to instead, provide the needed information via email.
 Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program
 Hi Phillip. We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
 Selection information.
 Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
 we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the
 database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the
 ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
 require additional information.
 We need each person's email address. Without the email address, we cannot
 email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
 we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have
 each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.
 So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
 to instead, provide the needed information via email.
 Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

  Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
 basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that 
 reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
 before and after bidweek.  
  
  The following observations can be made:
  July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
 actual of .79
  2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
  3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.
  Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
 actual of .99
  2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
  3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
 monthly postings
  4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

 the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any

  With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
 manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
 associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
 commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
 others in that category at year end.

 is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
  letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.
 Phillip","Hi Phillip,

Thank you for the update on the rent roll spreadsheet. I'll make the necessary modifications as you outlined:

1. I'll add the formula in column E to sum the values from columns C and D, and then copy it down the rows.
2. I'll insert the formula in column H to calculate the difference between the amount owed and the amount paid.
3. I'll adjust the width of column F to ensure the values are visible.
4. Once the rent section is updated, I'll move the database columns to the right, starting from column J.

Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to address.

Best regards,

 Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year. Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  
 He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA. Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?","Hi Alan Comnes,

Thank you for forwarding the request. I will update the table and ensure it reflects the necessary changes. I'll also work on the forward price curve for both gas and power in CA. You can expect to receive all the documents by Monday afternoon.

Please let me know if there's anything else you need.

  Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations:
  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf
  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 
  Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
 X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share
  That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think 
 crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.
  Current price 37
  Nat. Gas 34
  Crude 10
  Total 81
  
  Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this 
 looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
 Tosco, and SLB?
 Thank you,
  Phillip","Hi Phillip,

Thank you for sharing your observations and calculations. I will review the numbers and provide my thoughts on the valuation and potential risks. I'll also prepare and send you the reports on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB as soon as possible.

Thank you for sharing your observations and calculations on the EOG report. I appreciate the detailed analysis you've provided. I'll take a closer look at the numbers and evaluate the assumptions to see if there are any alternative perspectives or considerations.

 to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex. 
  What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
  Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.
 Thanks,
 Phillip","Hi Phillip,

Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you have a solid plan in place with your current exercise strategy. Regarding selling JDSU and buying SDLI, it could be a good move depending on the market conditions and your investment goals. I would recommend analyzing the financials and growth potential of both organizations to make an informed decision.

As for EOG, it could indeed be a promising play on rising oil and gas prices. I’ll take a closer look at their recent performance and market position and get back to you with more detailed insights.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need in the meantime.

Thanks for the update on your exercise plans. It sounds like a solid strategy with purchasing another apartment complex.

Regarding your question about selling JDSU to buy SDLI, I think it’s a good idea to evaluate the current market conditions and performance of both companies. SDLI has shown potential in recent trends, but it might be worthwhile to analyze their financials and future growth prospects before making a decision.

As for EOG, it could indeed be a strong play given the current rise in oil and gas prices. They have a robust portfolio and seem well-positioned in the market. Conducting a deeper dive into their latest performance and projections could provide more clarity.

Let me know if you need any more detailed analysis or further assistance.

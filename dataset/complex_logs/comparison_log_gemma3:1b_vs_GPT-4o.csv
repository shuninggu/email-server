The mentorship model could provide new employees with personalized guidance and foster a sense of belonging, which might be beneficial for retention. However, it would require us to ensure we have enough experienced staff available to serve as mentors.

On the other hand, a phased orientation schedule could allow new hires to gradually acclimate to their roles and responsibilities, potentially reducing overwhelm and increasing retention rates. It might be more scalable if we're onboarding a large number of employees.

Hi [Name],

Thank you for bringing up this important topic. Framing your proposal in a way that highlights the benefits for both employees and the organization can be very effective. You might consider emphasizing the positive impact on employee well-being, productivity, and work-life balance. Research shows that reducing after-hours work communication can lead to more engaged and focused employees during regular working hours.

Additionally, you could propose a trial period for the policy, allowing managers to see the potential benefits firsthand before making a final decision. This approach can also help address any concerns they may have about urgent communications.

I'm happy to discuss this further and help refine your proposal if needed.

Dear [Name],

Thank you for reaching out and following up on our previous discussion. To help address the transition plan for the departing team members, I would suggest considering the following steps: 

1. Identify key responsibilities and tasks that need to be transferred 
2. Develop a knowledge sharing plan with clear objectives and timelines
3. Schedule one-on-one meetings with departing employees to gather information and discuss their roles 
4. Create an internal document or knowledge base outlining processes, procedures and contact details for critical systems

I'd be happy to elaborate on these suggestions and provide any additional input you require.

Best regards,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the transition plan for the departing team members. I believe a phased approach would be beneficial in this case, allowing for an orderly handover of responsibilities and ensuring minimal disruption. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Preparation Phase**: The departing team members should begin documenting their current projects, processes, and knowledge sources. This could include creating detailed step-by-step guides, sharing key files, and organizing relevant resources.

2. **Training Phase**: The team members who will be taking over should be trained on the specific tasks and responsibilities that the departing colleagues held. This can involve one-on-one mentoring, workshops, or training sessions.

3. **Transition Phase**: During this phase, the new team members will gradually take over the duties of the departing ones under their guidance. This allows for any questions to be answered and any issues to be addressed in real time.

4. **Review Phase**: After the transition, it would be beneficial to review the overall process and make necessary adjustments. This could involve feedback sessions with both the departing and new team members.

Let's discuss these suggestions further to ensure we address any possible knowledge transfer issues and maintain smooth operations during this transition period.

2. Communication: While we have maintained regular communication with the client about the project's progress, it appears there might be some misalignment or misunderstanding regarding the revised timeline. I suggest a follow-up meeting to clarify any concerns and set realistic expectations moving forward.
3. Team Performance: Our team has been working diligently to meet the project milestones, but it seems that recent changes in team composition may have affected productivity. I will discuss this with the relevant team leads and explore potential solutions to optimize workflow.
4. Project Management Tools: We could consider implementing or improving our project management tools to better track progress and deadlines, ensuring all team members are aware of their tasks and timelines. This would also enable more efficient communication with clients about the project's status.

I am open to suggestions and would welcome any input you may have on this matter. Let's collaborate to ensure we deliver a high-quality product while meeting our client's expectations in terms of timeline. Thank you again for your attention to this issue.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing the feedback from our demo yesterday. I appreciate the detailed insights provided by the stakeholders, particularly the constructive criticism regarding the user interface.

Based on your feedback, I have come up with a few potential design changes that might address these concerns:

1. Simplify the navigation menu: Streamline the menu to reduce clutter and make it easier for users to find what they need quickly.

2. Increase white space: Reduce visual noise by increasing white space between elements, making the interface less crowded and more appealing to the eye.

3. Improve color contrast: Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background to improve readability and accessibility for all users.

4. Update button styles: Standardize button styles and make them more prominent within the design to ensure they are easily clickable and stand out from other elements.

5. Implement user feedback: Incorporate user feedback throughout the design process, testing prototypes with real users and iterating based on their responses.

I would be happy to discuss these changes further or explore alternative solutions if you have specific concerns or requirements in mind. Let's work together to create a user interface that not only meets but exceeds our stakeholders' expectations.

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to share some changes we will be implementing in our company policies, effective next month. These alterations have been carefully considered and are aimed at ensuring the continued growth and success of our team.

Firstly, I would like to address a few adjustments that may impact certain benefits we currently offer. Some of these reductions have become necessary due to various external factors, but please rest assured that we remain committed to providing you with a competitive compensation package and an enjoyable work environment.

Here are the specific changes:

1. Health Insurance Contribution: Our contribution towards your health insurance premiums will be reduced by 5%. We understand the importance of maintaining good health and will continue to offer comprehensive coverage options for our team.

2. Retirement Savings Match: Effective next month, our matching contributions to your retirement savings accounts will be adjusted from a 3% match to a 2% match. This change is intended to encourage self-reliance and financial independence within the team.

3. Paid Time Off (PTO) Allowance: The annual PTO allowance for all employees will be increased from 15 days to 20 days, effective immediately. We believe this additional time off will provide you with more opportunities to recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

4. Learning & Development Opportunities: We are excited to announce the expansion of our learning and development program! This program now includes access to a wide range of online courses, workshops, and conferences that can help you grow professionally and personally.

Please note that these changes will not affect your base salary or other benefits such as performance bonuses. If you have any questions about the specifics of these adjustments, please do not hesitate to reach out to Human Resources for more information.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time of change. We are committed to supporting our team members through every step of this transition and beyond. Thank you for your continued dedication and hard work, which makes our company the great place that it is.

Warm regards,

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for involving me in this important discussion regarding our onboarding workflow. I have given both proposals some thought, and I believe that the proposed mentorship model could be more effective in improving retention due to its personalized and supportive nature. A dedicated mentor can provide guidance, support, and answers to questions in real-time, which may help new hires feel more engaged and valued. However, it would be crucial to ensure a well-defined mentorship program, including clear roles and responsibilities for both the mentors and mentees.

That being said, I do acknowledge that a phased orientation schedule also has its merits, as it allows new hires to gradually adjust to their new environment and responsibilities. However, we should consider whether this approach may result in an extended onboarding period and potential confusion for the new hires, as they might not have a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of our organization before diving into their roles.

In conclusion, while both proposals show promise, I strongly recommend that we implement the proposed mentorship model after carefully considering and refining its design to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to discussing this further with you and exploring ways to make this initiative a success for our team.

Dear [Vendor Name],

We hope this email finds you well.

We are writing to inform you that our contract renewal with you is due next week. While the existing terms have served us well, we would like to explore the possibility of renegotiating the agreement to better align with our current requirements.

We are open to discussing potential adjustments that could benefit both parties, such as revising pricing, scope of work, or other key aspects of the contract. We are eager to find mutually beneficial terms that will enable us to continue working together effectively.

Dear [Vendor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss our upcoming vendor contract renewal, which is due next week.

Over the years, we have valued our partnership and the services you have provided us. However, as we are reviewing our contracts and strategic alignment for the coming year, we find ourselves in a position where the current terms are not as favorable to us as they once were. This decision is based on our evolving business needs and goals.

We understand that such changes may impact your operations, but rest assured that our intention is not to strain our relationship. Instead, we aim to establish terms that foster a mutually beneficial partnership in the long run.

To this end, I would appreciate it if we could schedule a meeting next week to discuss potential revisions to the contract. We look forward to working together to find a solution that works best for both parties.

Please let me know a suitable time and date for you, and I will do my best to accommodate it in our schedules.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

I'd be happy to help you brainstorm some ideas to make your keynote engaging for both technical and non-technical audiences. Here are a few potential approaches:

1. **Use storytelling**: Share personal anecdotes or case studies that illustrate the real-world implications of AI ethics in public policy. This can help non-technical audience members connect emotionally with the topic.
2. **Use simple, clear language**: Avoid using overly technical jargon or complex concepts that might confuse your non-technical audience. Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex ideas in simpler terms.
3. **Highlight the human impact**: Emphasize how AI ethics and public policy affect people's lives, rather than just focusing on technical details. This can help resonate with non-technical audience members who care about social and economic implications.
4. **Use visual aids and examples**: Use images, videos, or real-world examples to illustrate key points and make the topic more engaging for both audiences.
5. **Be clear about what you're trying to achieve**: Make it explicit that your talk is not just a technical overview, but also a discussion of how AI ethics can inform public policy.

Some potential title ideas to get you started:

* "The Intersection of AI Ethics and Public Policy: What Can We Learn from Each Other?"
* "How AI Ethics Can Inform More Just and Equitable Public Policies"
* "The Human Side of AI: How Policy Can Shape the Future of Artificial Intelligence"

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Do any of these ideas resonate with you, or is there another direction you'd like to explore?

I hope this email finds you well. Regarding your challenge in structuring a keynote for an interdisciplinary conference that bridges AI ethics and public policy, I have some suggestions that might help make it resonate with both technical and non-technical audiences.

Firstly, consider starting with a relatable scenario or real-world example to grab the audience's attention. This can help bridge the gap between technical and non-technical perspectives by grounding your talk in something tangible and understandable.

Secondly, use clear and concise language throughout your presentation. Avoid jargon where possible and provide explanations for technical terms as you introduce them. You might also consider using analogies or metaphors to help non-technical audience members visualize complex concepts.

Thirdly, break your talk into distinct sections with clear transitions between each one. Each section should address a key point or idea related to AI ethics and public policy, and you can use examples, case studies, and data to support your arguments. By organizing your talk in this way, you'll help guide your audience through the material and make it easier for them to follow along.

Lastly, remember that storytelling is a powerful tool for engaging audiences of all backgrounds. Consider incorporating personal stories or anecdotes into your talk where appropriate to make it more relatable and memorable for your listeners.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance. Good luck with your keynote!

While there is no cause for alarm, it is essential that we all take these measures seriously and ensure full compliance for the continued protection of our company's data and resources.

1. Password Policy: All passwords must be updated immediately using strong, unique combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid common phrases or easily guessed personal information.

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA will be mandatory for all users accessing the company network. This added layer of security significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

3. Regular Security Training: We will introduce a monthly security awareness training program to keep everyone up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices.

4. Reporting Suspicious Activity: If you notice anything unusual or suspicious, please report it immediately to your team leader or IT department for investigation.

5. Phishing Protection: Be cautious of emails asking for sensitive information, even if they appear to be from trusted sources. Do not click on any links within such emails unless you are absolutely sure of their authenticity.

We understand that these changes may require some adjustments, but we believe they are necessary steps towards maintaining the highest level of security and protecting our valuable assets. Your cooperation in this matter is crucial, and I appreciate your understanding and prompt action. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the IT department.

I understand that you're interested in taking full lead authorship on the paper we co-wrote. While I respect your initiative and believe in your capabilities, I would like to prioritize the equitable distribution of credit.

It's important to consider the contributions and efforts you and I have made to the paper. I believe that a fair approach would be to allocate joint authorship credits based on the percentage of effort each of us contributed.

I would be happy to discuss this further with you and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Please let me know when you're available to discuss this.

Dear [Collaborator's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I appreciate your enthusiasm and initiative regarding our co-authored paper. Your contributions have been invaluable, and I believe it's a testament to the success of our collaboration.

Regarding the lead authorship, I would prefer to maintain an equal contribution status on the paper. However, I understand that you feel a strong desire for lead authorship, given your significant input. I am open to discussing a potential solution that recognizes and rewards both our contributions fairly.

I propose we reconsider the structure of the paper to reflect our individual strengths more clearly, or perhaps add an additional author position with a suitable title to acknowledge your substantial contribution. This way, we can ensure the integrity and transparency of the authorship while maintaining a strong collaborative relationship.

Let's discuss this further at your earliest convenience to find a solution that suits us both. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.

You may consider highlighting the candidate's strengths and achievements while also addressing areas for improvement in a constructive manner. This approach will allow you to be honest without being overly critical.

Another strategy is to focus on specific examples that demonstrate the candidate's growth and progress, rather than dwelling on past mistakes or shortcomings.

Regarding my concerns about the candidate's recent performance, I believe it is crucial to address these issues while maintaining a supportive and constructive tone. Here are some suggestions for finding the right balance:

1. Begin by acknowledging the candidate's strengths and previous accomplishments. Highlighting their positive qualities will set the stage for an honest discussion about areas that need improvement.

2. Describe the specific instances or situations in which performance was less than optimal, focusing on facts and objective observations rather than personal opinions or judgments. Be sure to provide examples of behaviors or actions that demonstrate your concerns.

3. Offer suggestions for improvement based on your observations and experiences with the candidate. Be specific about the steps they can take to address these concerns and improve their performance moving forward. This will demonstrate that you are invested in their success and willing to help them grow professionally.

4. Emphasize the potential of the candidate and their ability to learn from this experience. By focusing on the future, you can express your confidence in their abilities while still addressing your concerns.

5. Conclude the letter by reiterating the candidate's strengths and positive qualities, and emphasizing that you believe they have what it takes to overcome any challenges they may face moving forward. This will help to balance the constructive criticism with a supportive message of encouragement.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in finding the right balance for your letter of recommendation. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. I am here to support you in this process.

Dear Team,

I appreciate your initiative in drafting a post-mortem report for our recent product launch. It's essential to understand the causes of this setback so we can learn, grow, and avoid similar pitfalls in future projects.

In addressing the causes of our product launch failure, let's aim to frame them constructively while also acknowledging accountability. Here are some suggestions:

1. Market Research Insights: Our market research may not have been as comprehensive or accurate as we initially thought. We can improve our approach by incorporating more diverse data sources and refining our analysis methods.

2. Product Development Process: There could be flaws in the product development process itself, such as inadequate prototyping or testing phases. Let's reevaluate these stages to ensure a smoother transition from ideation to launch.

3. Communication and Collaboration: Potential miscommunications or collaboration issues may have impacted the project. Enhancing our communication strategies, both internally and externally, will help us work more effectively together in the future.

4. Resource Allocation: We might have underestimated the resources required for a successful launch. Let's reassess our resource management practices to ensure that we have the necessary tools and personnel for each project.

5. Timeline Management: Deadlines may not have been met, resulting in a delayed launch. Improving our timeline management skills will help us meet milestones more efficiently.

Remember, our goal is to analyze these factors constructively without placing blame. Instead, we should focus on learning from this experience and using it as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to address an issue that has come to my attention regarding the recent duplication of work between our teams. I sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.

The purpose of this email is twofold: first, to acknowledge and apologize for the oversight, and second, to propose a solution that will help us move forward constructively.

To prevent such occurrences in the future, I am proposing the following steps:

1. A shared project workspace where all team members can easily access ongoing tasks and their statuses. This will help reduce duplication and ensure better coordination.
2. Regular cross-team meetings to discuss ongoing projects, share progress, and address any potential issues early on.
3. Clearer communication protocols to ensure everyone is informed about the status of their tasks and the work of others.
4. A feedback mechanism for team members to report any instances of duplicated work or communication breakdowns, so we can address them promptly.

I understand that these changes may require some adjustments, but I believe they will greatly improve our collaborative efforts and overall productivity.

Let's use this incident as an opportunity to learn, grow, and strengthen our teamwork. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in implementing these suggested measures.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am open to feedback and suggestions to further improve our workflow.

Thank you for your attention, and let's continue working together towards our shared goals.

Dear [Team member's name],

I understand that you're facing challenges in framing a performance review for a team member who has shown both inconsistency and potential. Maintaining a fair and motivating tone can be challenging, but it's crucial to acknowledge both sides of the story.

Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging the challenges they may be facing. By focusing on a collaborative approach and a shared goal of improvement, you can work together to find a positive outcome.

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing in regards to our ongoing discussions about the proposed project timeline.

We have been closely reviewing the details and appreciate your team's diligence and efforts towards the project. However, we have some concerns regarding the current timeline that we believe needs a slight adjustment.

After careful consideration of our internal resources and commitments, we estimate that we may require an additional [number of days/weeks] to ensure that the quality of work is not compromised. We understand this might alter the initial plan, but we are confident that this extension will help us deliver a superior product.

We highly value your partnership and do not wish for any potential delays to jeopardize our working relationship. We believe that open communication and mutual understanding will lead to a successful project completion.

Please let us know if there are any concerns or adjustments on your end regarding this revised timeline. We look forward to continuing our collaboration and achieving great results together.

Thank you for sharing this proposal. I understand you’re anticipating potential resistance from management. To effectively frame this, let’s focus on highlighting the potential benefits and addressing concerns proactively.

2025-04-04 13:11:29,824 INFO: [Row 40] Model: llama3.2:3b | Time: 21.23s | Output: Dear [Recipient],

I'd like to propose a new company policy that establishes clear guidelines for late-night work communications, with the aim of promoting better work-life balance and reducing burnout among employees.

The proposed policy would limit work-related communication and collaboration outside of regular working hours (defined as 5pm-10am), except in cases where urgent or emergency matters require attention. This policy change is intended to benefit both employees and the organization, by improving productivity during working hours and reducing the likelihood of work creeping into personal time.

To address potential concerns from managers who may be accustomed to working late, I suggest framing this proposal as an opportunity to re-evaluate our current workflows and prioritize employee well-being. By adopting this new policy, we can demonstrate our commitment to creating a healthier and more sustainable work environment that supports the overall success of our team.

I'd appreciate your thoughts on this proposal and look forward to discussing it further with you.

 Dear Team,

 I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to propose a new policy aimed at promoting work-life balance and enhancing overall team productivity. The policy suggests limiting late-night work communications to encourage a healthier work environment for everyone.

 While I understand that some of our managers might have concerns about the potential impact on project deliverables, it is essential to remember that burnout can be just as detrimental to our work as delays caused by fatigue and decreased efficiency.

 To address these concerns, I would like to suggest a phased implementation approach:

 1. Begin with an education campaign about the benefits of a balanced work schedule for both mental health and productivity.
 2. Introduce a trial period during which we monitor the impact on project delivery times and team morale.
 3. Based on the results, make adjustments as necessary to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining optimal productivity.

 I believe that by fostering an environment where our team members can recharge and refocus, we will ultimately see improved performance and increased job satisfaction. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts on this proposal, as your feedback is invaluable in shaping our work culture.

 Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to collaborating with each of you to create a more balanced and productive workplace.

Dear [Student's Name],

I understand that you are requesting an exception to the course requirement for [Course Name]. However, I am unable to grant this exception due to the borderline nature of your case.

I have carefully reviewed your academic record and the course syllabus, and I am unable to find any extenuating circumstances that would justify your request. The requirements for this course are designed to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed, and granting an exception would undermine this purpose.

I would suggest that you consider other options, such as completing additional assignments or seeking a waiver for a valid medical or personal reason. Please reach out to me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for reaching out regarding the exception to the course requirement for [Course Name]. After careful consideration, I must inform you that your case is indeed borderline. As much as I understand your situation and the potential benefits of granting this exception, it is important to maintain the integrity and consistency of our academic policies.

However, I am willing to discuss this matter further in order to find a solution that best serves both your educational needs and the requirements of the course. I would like to arrange a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss this in more detail. Please let me know a suitable time for you so we can schedule our discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Subject: Rebalancing the Message

Hi [Colleague's Name],

Thank you for your prompt response and willingness to step up during the crisis. Your actions were greatly appreciated.

While I acknowledge your efforts, I also believe that we could have anticipated and prepared for such a situation better. It would have been helpful if we had had a clear plan in place, including communication protocols and emergency response procedures.

I would like to suggest that we discuss how we can improve our planning and communication in the future. Perhaps we could create a shared document outlining our roles and responsibilities during a crisis. Additionally, we could conduct regular drills to ensure that we are all familiar with the plan.

I value your dedication and hard work, and I am confident that we can learn from this experience. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you.

I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your quick thinking and decisive action during our recent team emergency. Your prompt response and leadership helped minimize the impact of the crisis, and I'm grateful that everything turned out well.

However, as we've reflected on the incident, I think it would be beneficial to discuss ways to improve our preparedness and planning in the future. While your actions were instrumental in managing the situation, there are steps we can take to prevent similar crises from occurring in the first place.

Would you be open to discussing potential improvements to our emergency procedures and protocols? Perhaps we could schedule a meeting to review our current plans and brainstorm ways to enhance them.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

2025-04-13 21:40:05,516 INFO: [Row 1] Model: llama3.2:3b | Input: Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.
 As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.  The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  
 My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your email with great suggestions on how to approach our business meetings during the trip. I agree that adding some informal discussion and relaxation time can help stimulate discussions across different groups.

Regarding location, Austin sounds like an excellent choice - we can plan some fun activities outside of the meeting time, such as golfing, renting a ski boat or jet skis. It's definitely worth considering flying somewhere for meetings if it means having more productive discussions in a round table format.

I'll take your suggestions into consideration and let you know if there's anything else you'd like to add or change. Looking forward to hearing back from you.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
 start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
 to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
 another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
 my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
 in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
 past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
 the enormous number of things she does everyday.  Fortunately, it looks as
 if she will be ok in the long run.

Thank you for forwarding this preliminary proforma for the Westgate property in Austin to me. I am excited about the potential return of over 40% per year for three years and the strong market conditions.

I appreciate the details regarding the zoning, site plan requirements, and the waived water treatment ordinances. The estimated lot improvement costs seem reasonable based on your research.

I am interested in learning more about the project and would like to schedule a tour of the site and the area as soon as possible. Could you please let me know when this is feasible?

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 Phillip,
  Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
 requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
 trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
 the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
 on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
 consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
 consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
 inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
 consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
 arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
 happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
 consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
 building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
 future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
 requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
 plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
 The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
 themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
 project.
 I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
 good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
 we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
 positions, I think we still have the following issues:
 We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group. We've had 
 three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
 traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
 requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
 We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
 be outside the scope of position consolidation.
 Things left to do:
 I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
 make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
 project. It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
 Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
 project and which fall out of scope.
 For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
 work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
 Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
 drill downs.
 Use the above to formulate a project plan.
 Things requested thus far (no particular order):
 Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
 ticker.
 Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
 add up existing position manager rows/columns).
 New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
 transport, swaps, options, ...
 Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
 of all curves on which the desk has a position.
 Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
 shown directly above monthly positions. Each grouped column in the top grid 
 would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
 Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
 appropriate positions to show for each:
 Gas Daily for monthly index,
 Physical gas for Nymex,
 Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
 Physical gas for Mid market.
 Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
 using official valuations.
 Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
 Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:

Subject: Re: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Hi Richard,

Thanks for forwarding Allan's email and your input on the consolidated positions issues and to-do list. I agree that we need to focus on the first bullet point - creating a single set of requirements.

I'll work with the traders to try to reach a consensus regarding these requirements, but it may be difficult due to varying opinions from different traders. 

Let's schedule a meeting for Monday between 3-5 PM as you mentioned in Allan's email to discuss and design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen. This is critical to creating a plan that can be measured.

I'll also review the list of requested features to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope. I'll work with traders to define the exact requirements of each item that falls within the project's scope.

Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to formulate a high-level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.

Looking forward to discussing these topics on Monday.

Best regards,

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 Phillip,
  Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
 requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
 trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
 the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
 on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
 consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
 consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
 inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
 consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
 arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
 happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
 consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
 building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
 future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
 requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
 plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
 The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
 themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
 project.
 I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
 good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
 we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list
 From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
 positions, I think we still have the following issues:
 We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group. We've had 
 three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
 traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
 requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
 We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
 be outside the scope of position consolidation.
 Things left to do:
 I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
 make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
 project. It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
 Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
 project and which fall out of scope.
 For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
 work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
 Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
 drill downs.
 Use the above to formulate a project plan.
 Things requested thus far (no particular order):
 Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
 ticker.
 Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
 add up existing position manager rows/columns).
 New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
 transport, swaps, options, ...
 Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
 of all curves on which the desk has a position.
 Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
 shown directly above monthly positions. Each grouped column in the top grid 
 would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
 Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
 appropriate positions to show for each:
 Gas Daily for monthly index,
 Physical gas for Nymex,
 Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
 Physical gas for Mid market.
 Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
 using official valuations.
 Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
 Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
 Inclusion of spread options in our systems. Ability to handle volatility 
 skew and correlations.
 Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
 Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
 gamma grid.
 Valuation of Gas Daily options.
 A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta). TBD.
 Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
 Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
 manager.
 Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker. Show new deal terms, 
 prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
 Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
 Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
 individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.

 Subject: Westgate
 Westgate
 Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
 Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
 on San Marcos that you received earlier.
 If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
 Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?
 San Marcos
 The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
 sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for $2.50 per square
 foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
 San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.
 Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
 and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
 $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This
 property will have the best location for student housing of all new
 projects, just as the duplexes do now.
 If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
 is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
 yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. I will
 know more on this question later today.
 Sincerely,
 George W. Richards

  From: Phillip K Allen  09/28/2000 10:56 AM
  
 Liane,
  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
 manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single 
 buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
 market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, 
 offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
 bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
 calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
 financial swaps for San Juan.
  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
 September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from 
 Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
 firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
 trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas 
 daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
 relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:
  1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
 than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 
  2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
 Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and 
  October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
 are dramatically different.
  I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the 
 trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
 determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
 outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
 establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
 $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
 calculation of index.
  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
 conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me 
 anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
 Sincerely,
 Phillip Allen

I appreciate your concerns regarding potential manipulation of the El Paso San Juan monthly index. The trades executed from September 25 to September 27, as outlined in the attached spreadsheet, suggest that a single buyer entered the market on both days and paid above-market prices for San Juan gas.

The high physical prices on these days are significantly higher than the corresponding financial trades, which raises questions about their validity. I understand your desire to exclude these trades from the index calculation due to their potential as outliers.

I agree that reliable and accurate indices are essential for our business operations. I will review the submitted trades thoroughly, including any information provided by counterparty names, to determine the authenticity of these transactions.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any further assistance or clarification on this matter. Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention, and I look forward to working with you to establish a reasonable index.

 Subject: Investment Structure
 STRUCTURE:
 Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
 general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
 liability of construction.
 LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
 The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
 any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
 the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
 all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
 loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
 that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
 is reduced.
 All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
 full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
 the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
 non-recourse.
 USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
 The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
 architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
 organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
 many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
 Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
 the estimated 6 month design and approval period.
 EARLY LAND COSTS
 The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
 represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
 extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
 probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
 price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
 monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
 approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.
 EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
 Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
 the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
 the "fiscals". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
 improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
 improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
 for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
 completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
 expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
 improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
 irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
 development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
 spent no interest is charged on these funds.
 The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
 finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
 high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
 $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
 obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
 provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
 improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.  Even if the maximum loan would
 cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
 spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
 preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
 tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
 significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.
 Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
 lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.  Of this, probably
 $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The
 improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
 costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
 landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for
 undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
 estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the
 loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give
 you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
 of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
 is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
 separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
 standpoint.
 CONSTRUCTION LOANS
 There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
 (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is
 a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
 builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
 loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
 start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
 in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any
 construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
 difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.
 Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
 pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
 be from 80% to 95% of value.
 DISBURSEMENTS
 Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
 near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
 payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
 will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
 fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
 These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
 calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
 expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
 to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
 cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
 function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
 from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
 Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
 used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
 any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
 to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.
 REPORTING
 We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
 What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
 reporting.
 BOOKKEEPING
 I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
 procedures to record actual expenses?" Please expand.
 INVESTOR INPUT
 We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. As always
 the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
 experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
 Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
 effort to be accommodating.
 CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
 CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
 formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
 obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
 subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
 for vendors they are constantly shopped.
 PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
 Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
 provide these if you are interested.
 I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
 when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

 George Richards

Thank you for the comprehensive overview of the project and the various components involved in its execution. We appreciate the detailed explanation of each stage, from pre-construction to post-delivery.

We are pleased to provide input on design and materials, as we believe this will enhance the overall quality of the project. However, we understand that final say rests with you and Keith. We would like to request regular updates on progress, including a timeline for completion and any changes or adjustments made during the construction phase.

Regarding bookkeeping procedures, could you please provide more information on what you are referring to? Are there specific accounting practices or software that you use?

We are also interested in learning more about your procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and professionals. While we understand that flexibility is necessary in such a tight labor market, we would appreciate any guidance on how to navigate these interactions.

Finally, could you please provide the list of pre-selected professionals, subs, and vendors that you mentioned? We are eager to review this information and begin working with your team.

We look forward to reviewing the document you provided and discussing further details in a call. Please let us know when you have a chance to review it.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

 Subject: Investment Structure
 STRUCTURE:
 Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
 general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
 liability of construction.
 LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
 The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
 any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
 the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
 all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
 loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
 that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
 is reduced.
 All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
 full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
 the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
 non-recourse.
 USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
 The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
 architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
 organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
 many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
 Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
 the estimated 6 month design and approval period.
 EARLY LAND COSTS
 The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
 represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
 extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
 probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
 price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
 monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
 approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.
 EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
 Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
 the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
 the "fiscals". This cost represents a bond for the completion of
 improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
 improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
 for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
 completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
 expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
 improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
 irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
 development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
 spent no interest is charged on these funds.
 The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
 finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
 high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000
 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
 $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
 obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement

 improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.  Even if the maximum loan would

 Just wanted to give you an update. I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings. At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing. Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid. Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Thank you for keeping me informed about the project updates. I'm glad to hear that Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings and that we have the opportunity to revisit our bid once they're complete.

Please let me know when you'll be sending over the revised bid, so I can review it and discuss any changes with our team.

 Subject: closing
 Jeff, 
 ?
 Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isn't binding 
 as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesn't sound like 
 anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate 
 closing--but, of course, I could be wrong.? 
 ?
 If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is 
 no point in me following up on this?document's validity.? 
 ?
 I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what's there and 
 find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can.
 ?
 I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable 
 document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? 
 This isn't either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last 
 night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
 this is out of his area but doesn't sound binding to him.? 
 ?
 I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's transaction?and take a look at 
 that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even 
 needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any

 ?
 I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself 
 and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn't 
 seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my 
 signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it 
 reviewed before I accept it.

"Hi Brenda,

I spoke with Phillip and he can confirm that the closing will indeed take place today as scheduled. However, regarding the document you received, Phillip explained that this is not a formal contract but rather an addendum to your original agreement. He assured me that it's standard practice for these types of closings.

If there are any discrepancies or concerns, we can review them together before proceeding with the signing process. Please let me know if you're available after 12 noon today and I'll coordinate a meeting time that works for both of us.

Best regards,
Jeff"

I was hoping we could schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the status of our project with PG&E. I've done some additional research and it appears that their expected End-of-Life (EOL) is closer than initially thought, so I'd like to touch base with you as soon as possible.

Can we schedule a call for this week or next? I'm available Monday through Thursday afternoons. Let me know what works best for your schedule.

  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
 project:
  Ownership Structure
  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?
  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
 capacity(regarding ownership and 
  liabilities)?
  Who owns the land? improvements?
  Who holds the various loans?
  Is the land collateral?
  Investment
  
  What happens to initial investment?
  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
  
  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?
  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
 schedule?
  Investment Return
  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?
  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
 are distributed?
  Debt
  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
 is associated with each 
  loan?
  Improvement
  Construction
  Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement.
  Terms of each loan?
  Uses of Funds
  How will disbursements be made? By whom?
  What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
 for investors?
  Reports to track expenses vs plan?
  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?
  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get 
 paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
  general contractor and paid gain out of profits?
  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
 before the ultimate payout of profits?
  Design and Construction
  
  When will design be complete?
  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?
  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
 planning and permitting?
  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
 vendors, and other professionals? 
  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?
  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
 use? Names?
 These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
 in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as
 much as possible from the process.

Dear Phillip,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for providing the list of questions regarding the Westgate project that Keith and you had. I will do my best to address each of your concerns and provide clarity on the current ownership structure, legal entities involved, loan information, investment specifics, debt details, construction process, design, and other aspects of the project.

Please let me know which specific questions you would like me to focus on first, and I will do my best to provide detailed responses. If there's anything else you'd like to add or discuss, please don't hesitate to reach out.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
 start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
 to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
 another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
 my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
 in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
 past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
 the enormous number of things she does everyday.  Fortunately, it looks as
 if she will be ok in the long run.

  Here sales numbers from Reagan:
  
  
  As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 
 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
 units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
 under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
 competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
 actually done to date. 
  Let me know what you think. I will follow up with an email and phone call 
 about Cherry Creek. I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
 rejected on the De Ville property.

 Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
 Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
 that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
 should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
 This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
 Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
 this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
 have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
 The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
 it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
 for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
 in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
 water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
 improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
 Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
 widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
 widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
 requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
 expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
 successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
 adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
 As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
 is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
 only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
 preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
 preferences.
 The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
 an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
 plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
 an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
 This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
 profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
 having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
 with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
 rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
 be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
 exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
 Antonio if you do not know anyone.
 I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
 by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
 Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
 schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
 your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
 time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
 512-338-1103.  I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
 on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
 I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
 events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
 downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
 One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
 start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
 to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
 another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
 my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
 in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
 past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
 the enormous number of things she does everyday.  Fortunately, it looks as
 if she will be ok in the long run.

Thank you for forwarding the proforma for the Westgate property and for your enthusiastic presentation of this project. I appreciate the time and effort you've put into preparing this document and sharing it with me.

I'm excited to learn more about this project, especially given the strong potential for returns over 40% per year for three years. The fact that the property is located in a "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development makes it even more appealing.

Please let me know your availability for a site visit and I'll schedule it accordingly. In the meantime, I've received the package you mentioned and have reviewed the proforma. I look forward to discussing this further with you.

Best regards,
George Richards

 Subject: Sagewood Town Homes
 I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
 duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's, He does have a much
 lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
 to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
 We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
 the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
 footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his
 sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
 for $203,108.
 What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
 rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
 evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
 were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
 units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
 Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Dear George,

Thank you for your email regarding Sagewood Town Homes. We appreciate the details you provided about Regan Lehman's sales strategy and pricing for his units. However, we need to review our own data on rental rates and market demand before making any decisions.

We agree that the 3-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is in strong demand, and we would like to discuss the possibility of building additional units with four bedrooms if we were able to acquire more lots from Regan Lehman.

I will call you today as planned to go over this further and explore potential opportunities for Creekside Builders, LLC.

  Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
 opportunities.
  I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
 built by Reagan Lehmann. 22 Units were sold for 
  around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
 that he had more units under construction that would be 
  available in the 180's. Are the units he is selling significantly different 
 from yours? He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
  plan. My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  
  As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  
  Call or email with your thoughts.

 Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth. I 
 have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
 The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
 distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
 power quality reasons.
 The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
 to server farms and technology companies. There is a 100 MW server farm 
 trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
 due to distribution infrastructure issues. Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
 Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
 awakening in the next 2-3 years.

 Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
  Local Utilities 
  ( September 05, 2000 ) 
  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
 Tukwila. 
  The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
 computer servers for the
  region's growing number of dot-coms. 
  Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
 construction
  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
 a mile from its
  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
 fiber optic backbones, the
  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
 eventually
  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
 Microsoft and Onvia.com. 
  Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
 centers near Seattle.
  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
 Globix and
  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
 the networking
  equipment of the Internet economy. 
  It is a big business that could have an effect on 
 everything from your
  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
 your favorite Web sites.
  Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
 server farms, are
  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
 Valley that some
  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
 Puget Sound
  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
 high-security
  facilities. 
  "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
 are requesting 445
  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall," 
 said Karl
  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
 Energy. "That is
  the equivalent of six oil refineries." 
  A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
 the rise of the Internet
  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
 heads. 
  Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
 Utilities and
  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
 data centers. The
  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
 residential and business
  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
 necessary to support
  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
 million each,
  Karzmar said. 
  Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
 bring up the data center
  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 
  For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
 businesses and schools in the
  region, this is a new and complex issue. 
  On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
 appetite for power --
  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
 facilities run 24 hours a
  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
 constant revenue
  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
 they could
  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
 expenditures. 
  Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
 mean for power rates
  in the area is still open to debate. 
  "These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
 loads," said Bob Royer,
  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
 City Light. 
  "The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
 lights at the football
  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
 We have data
  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
 and 50 megawatts." 
  With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
 complex in Tukwila is
  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
 the 1.35 million
  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
 Boeing Space &
  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
 92 percent of the
  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
 companies. 
  "It is probably the largest data center park in the 
 country," boasts Laurent
  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
 Communications,
  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
 Networks all
  lease space in the office park. 
  After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
 Sabey has become an
  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
 management or
  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
 claims his firm is
  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
 the country. 
  As more people access the Internet and conduct 
 bandwidth-heavy tasks
  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
 co-location space in
  Seattle continues to escalate. 
  But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
 space is growing at a
  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
 causing similar
  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
 California. 
  Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
 space, plans to nearly
  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
 While companies
  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
 high-tech companies
  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
 as Exodus that
  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
 management. 
  "We have 2 million square feet of space under 
 construction and we plan to
  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
 demand right now
  than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account 
 executive at Exodus in
  Seattle. 
  The booming market for co-location space has left some 
 in the local utility
  industry perplexed. 
  "It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
 to serve the growth,"
  said Seattle City Light's Royer. "The utility industry is 
 almost stunned by this, in
  a way."

Here are some key points:

* The rapid growth of internet data centers is causing concerns among utilities, as these facilities require massive amounts of power.
* Seattle City Light and Puget Sound Energy are struggling to handle the increased demand for power from data centers, with some requesting up to 445 megawatts of power in a small area.
* Utilities are proposing tariffs to help offset the costs of supporting data centers, but this raises questions about who will pay for these expenditures and how it will affect power rates.
* The demand for co-location space is accelerating rapidly, with companies like Amazon.com running their own server farms and many high-tech companies outsourcing operations to companies like Exodus.
* Utilities are caught off guard by the rapid growth of data centers and are having to adapt quickly to serve this new market.

Let me know if you'd like me to summarize anything further!

 Hi Phillip. We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
 Selection information.
 Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
 we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the
 database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the
 ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
 require additional information.
 We need each person's email address. Without the email address, we cannot
 email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
 we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have
 each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.
 So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
 to instead, provide the needed information via email.
 Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

  Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
 basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that 
 reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
 before and after bidweek.  
  
  The following observations can be made:
  July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
 actual of .79
  2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
  3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.
  Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
 actual of .99
  2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
  3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
 monthly postings
  4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.
  
  Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
 the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any

 Brad,
  With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
 manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
 associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
 commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
 others in that category at year end.  
  Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
 Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.
  Let me know if there are any issues.

Dear Phillip,

I have some concerns regarding the proposed promotion of Tori Kuykendall to commercial manager. While she has taken on responsibilities that resemble those of a commercial manager, I am not entirely convinced that her performance warrants a full conversion from support manager. Can we discuss this further and consider alternative options for recognizing her contributions?

  The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. See if you can add 
 these modifications:
  1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It 
 should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below.
  2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
 =e6-g6.
  3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width 
 is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
  letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.
  4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
 this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Subject: Re: Modifications to Rent Roll Spreadsheet

Hi Phillip,

The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. I have made the following modifications:
 
 1. I added the formula =c6+d6 to column E and copied it down.
 2. I added the formula =e6-g6 to column H.
 3. I expanded the width of column F by dragging the boundary to make room for more data.
 4. I will move the database columns up to this sheet once the rent part is fixed, and place them in columns J beyond.

Let me know if these changes meet your requirements or if you need further modifications.

  Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations:
  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf
  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 
  Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
 X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share
  That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think 
 crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.
  Current price 37
  Nat. Gas 34
  Crude 10
  Total 81
  
  Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this 
 looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
 Tosco, and SLB?
 Thank you,
  Phillip
2025-04-13 21:55:33,047 INFO: [Row 95] Model: llama3.2:3b | Time: 21.51s | Output: Hi Phillip,

I appreciate your kind words regarding the research report. I'd be happy to play devil's advocate and provide some counterpoints.

While the estimated gas price of $2.95/mcf is higher than current market prices, it's also important to consider the impact of inflation on the company's revenue and expenses. If inflation continues to rise, our estimates may need to be adjusted downward.

Regarding the recalculation of EPS with more accurate gas prices, I agree that a higher EPS would result in a higher valuation. However, there are other factors to consider when evaluating the stock's potential for growth. For example, what about the company's debt levels and capital expenditure plans?

I've also taken note of your suggestion that crude oil prices may be undervalued by $10/share. While this could potentially impact the company's revenue, it's essential to analyze the underlying drivers of the market and assess the likelihood of such a price increase.

I'd be happy to provide you with reports on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB as requested. I'll send them over separately.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,

We have been working on different apartments today and having to listen to different people about what Mary is saying. Should I be worried? Ants seem to be invading my apartment. You got my other fax's Wade is working on the bulletin board that I need up so that I can let tenants know about what is going on. Gave #25 a notice about having too many people staying in that apt and that problem has been resolved. Also, I have a tenant in #29 that is complaining about #28 using foul language. I sent #28 a lease violation, we will see how that goes. Call you tomorrow. Thanx Lucy

 to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex. 
  What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
  Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.
 Thanks,
 Phillip
